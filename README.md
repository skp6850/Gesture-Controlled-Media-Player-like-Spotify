# Gesture-Controlled-Media-Player-like-Spotify
This project involves creating a gesture-controlled media player using computer vision techniques and hand gesture recognition.

A set of predefined hand gestures that control media playback functions:

**Zero defects:** No action, 

**One defect:** Play/Pause media, 

**Two defects:** Volume Up, 

**Three defects:** Volume Down, 

**Four defects:** Forward.

This project successfully demonstrates the application of computer vision for controlling media playback through hand
gestures, providing a touch-free and intuitive user experience. The implemented system can be further enhanced and
adapted for various other applications requiring gesture-based interactions.
